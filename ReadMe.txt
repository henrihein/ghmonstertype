Program to generate an image for Gloomhaven monster types.
The program takes as input the monster types (none, normal,
or elite) for 2, 3 and 4 players, and horizontal or vertical
orientation, then generates an image for the monster types.
The background is transparent.  The image can then easily be
merged with a monster image to create the final monster
configuration.

Run program with no parameters to see usage/parameters.
